## What You Need

- Fresh coffee beans
- Burr grinder (for example, Baratza Encore)
- Coffee filters
- Coffee machine (for example, Moccamaster Technivorm)
- Scale that measures in grams
- Measuring cup that measures in milliliters
- Coffee cup

## Preparation Steps

Before you begin, ensure that your coffee grinder and machine are clean. This will prevent old coffee flavors from mixing with your fresh brew. Also, consider storing your beans in an airtight container to keep them fresh.

## Measure the Coffee

1. Open the coffee bag.
2. Place a bowl on the scale and zero it.
3. Add 60 grams of coffee beans for every liter of water you plan to brew.

## Grind the Coffee

A proper grind is crucial for great coffee. We recommend a medium grind for balanced flavor. If your coffee tastes too bitter, try a coarser grind. If it's too sour, a finer grind may be necessary.

1. Set the grinder to a medium setting (18 on the Baratza).
2. Grind the beans until you have the desired amount.
3. Transfer the grounds to the filter in the brew basket.

## Measure the Water

Use 1 liter of high-quality water for every 60 grams of coffee. If tap water quality is poor, filtered or bottled water is recommended.

1. Fill a measuring cup to the 1-liter mark.
2. Pour the water into the coffee machine's reservoir.

## Brew the Coffee

Ensure your coffee maker is assembled correctly and placed on a stable, heat-resistant surface. Plug the coffee maker into a grounded outlet and turn it on.

1. Place the carafe in position.
2. Turn on the coffee maker.
3. Wait until brewing completes.

## Post-Brew

Once brewing is done, turn off the coffee maker. Consider using the spent coffee grounds as compost for your garden.

## Enjoy Your Coffee

1. Pour the freshly brewed coffee into your cup.
2. Take a moment to enjoy the aroma.
3. Sip and enjoy.

## Summary

You've learned how to measure, grind, and brew coffee. This simple method ensures a delicious cup every time.
