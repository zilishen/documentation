### Important Notes

- Installing L4 accelerated mitigation feature (install `app-protect-dos-ebpf`) configures `nginx` and `admd` to run with root privileges.

- Support for `proxy_protocol` configuration: `proxy_protocol` monitor parameter should be used when the `listen` directive of the correspondent server block contains the `proxy_protocol` parameter.

- If NGINX App Protect WAF is installed, app protect should be disabled for the location of DoS Live Activity Monitoring API.

    For example:

    ```shell
    location /api {
    app_protect_enable off;
    app_protect_dos_api;
    }
    ```

- Port configuration in `app_protect_dos_monitor` should correspond to the port, the server listens to. Misconfiguration can potentially cause a false attack declaration.

    For example:

    ```shell
        server {
            listen 8080;
            server_name myservice.com;
            location / {
                app_protect_dos_monitor "myservice.com:8080/";
            }
        }
    ```

- `proxy_request_buffering` off is not supported.

- gRPC and HTTP/2 protection require active monitoring of the protected service. The directive `app_protect_dos_monitor` is mandatory for the attack to be detected.

- [TLS fingerprint]({{< ref "/nap-dos/directives-and-policy/learn-about-directives-and-policy.md#policy-directive-app_protect_dos_policy_file" >}}) feature is not used in CentOS 7.4 and RHEL 7 / UBI 7 due to the old OpenSSL version. The required OpenSSL version is 1.1.1 or higher.

- Slow POST attack always mitigates with block action while other types of attacks can also be mitigated with redirection or JS challenges.

- The recommended option of running NGINX Plus in a Docker Container is with the `daemon off` flag. It's mandatory for UBI 8.

- The package dependencies for NGINX App Protect DoS have changed in this release, replacing the `curl` dependencies with `libcurl` only. For more information, see the [NGINX App Protect DoS Deployment Guide]({{< ref "/nap-dos/deployment-guide/learn-about-deployment.md#prerequisites" >}}).

- Starting with this release, Ubuntu 18.04 support has been deprecated.
