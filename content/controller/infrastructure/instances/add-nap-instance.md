## Overview

Follow the directions in this topic to deploy F5 NGINX App Protect and add the instance to NGINX Controller.

## Deploy NGINX App Protect

<div data-proofer-ignore>

Install NGINX App Protect on a host accessible by your NGINX Controller instance by following the appropriate steps for your operating system in the [Using NGINX App Protect with NGINX Controller]({{< ref "controller/admin-guides/install/install-for-controller.md" >}}) guide.

{{< note >}}
If you install NGINX App Protect by using any of the OS-specific install guides, **do not make changes to the `nginx.conf` file**.
The NGINX Controller Agent manages `nginx.conf` settings and will make the appropriate adjustments for you.
