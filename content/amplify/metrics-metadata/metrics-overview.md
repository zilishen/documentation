Most metrics are collected by F5 NGINX Amplify Agent without requiring the user to perform any additional setup. For troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Metrics Collection]({{< ref "/amplify/nginx-amplify-agent/troubleshooting-metrics-collection.md" >}}).

Some additional metrics for NGINX monitoring will only be reported if the NGINX configuration file is modified accordingly. See [Additional NGINX Metrics]({{< ref "/amplify/metrics-metadata/nginx-metrics#additional-nginx-metrics" >}}), and review the *Source* and *Variable* fields in the metric descriptions that follow.
