You can use tools such as `curl` or [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to interact with the API Connectivity Manager REST API. The API URL follows the format `https://<NMS_FQDN>/api/acm/<API_VERSION>` and must include authentication information with each call. For more information about authentication options, please refer to the [API Overview]({{< ref "/nms/acm/about/api-overview.md" >}}).
