In API Connectivity Manager, you can apply cluster policies to API Gateways and Developer Portals to further enhance their configuration to meet your requirements. A proxy cluster is a group of instances configured as API Gateways or Developer Portals. Any cluster policy will apply to all instances in a group.

If a proxy cluster is shared between environments, updating cluster policies will effect all the environments.

See the [Learn about Policies]({{< ref "/nms/acm/about/policies-overview.md">}}) topic for an overview of the different policy types and available policies.
