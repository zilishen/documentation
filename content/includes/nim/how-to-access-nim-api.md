You can use tools like `curl` or [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to interact with the NGINX Instance Manager REST API. The API URL is `https://<NIM-FQDN>/api/[nim|platform]/<API_VERSION>`, and each request requires authentication. For more details on authentication options, see the [API Overview]({{< ref "/nim/fundamentals/api-overview.md" >}}).
