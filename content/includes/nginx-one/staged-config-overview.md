It takes time to set up NGINX configuration files. Staged Configurations can help. They work like a draft that uses the features of NGINX One Console. The Staged Configuration does not have to be valid.
You can save your work before you push a configuration to an instance of NGINX.

With Staged Configurations, you can use these features of NGINX One Console:

- Automatic syntax checking
- Contextual documentation
- Dynamic analysis of your work in progress
- Suggestions from our AI assistant

Once you've finished your work and have pushed the changes to an Instance or a Config Sync Group, you can next delete that Staged Configuration.
