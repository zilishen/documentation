To access the NGINX Instance Manager web interface, open a web browser and go to `https://<NMS_FQDN>`, replacing `<NMS_FQDN>` with the Fully Qualified Domain Name of your NGINX Instance Manager host.

The default administrator username is `admin`, and the generated password was displayed in the terminal during installation. If you'd like to change this password, refer to the "[Set or Change User Passwords]({{< ref "/nim/admin-guide/authentication/basic-auth/set-up-basic-authentication.md#set-basic-passwords-script" >}}) section in the Basic Authentication topic.
