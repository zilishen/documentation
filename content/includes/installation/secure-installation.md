To ensure that your NGINX Management Suite deployment remains secure, follow the recommendations in this section:

- Install NGINX Management Suite and its modules on a dedicated machine (bare metal, container, cloud, or VM).
- Make sure that no other services are running on the same machine.
- Make sure that the machine is not accessible from the Internet.
- Make sure that the machine is behind a firewall.
