GraphQL is an API technology that has grown rapidly in recent years and is continuing to gain traction. GraphQL is a query language designed for APIs to use in the development of client applications that access large data sets with intricate relations among themselves. It provides an intuitive application and flexible syntax for describing data requirements. <br>

GraphQL provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST APIs. This makes it easier to retrieve the data you require in a single request and helps in overcoming challenges which include under-fetching and over-fetching of data. GraphQL also enables faster front-end development without the need for new API endpoints (GraphQL works on a single endpoint), great backend analytics using GraphQL queries and a structured schema and type system.

GraphQL also allows the client to specify exactly what data it needs, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network and improving the overall performance of the application.

In the following sections, you will learn more about enabling GraphQL configuration (using basic and advanced configuration) plus GraphQL security, GraphQL profile and URL settings.
