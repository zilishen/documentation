|Enforcement by Violation Rating | By default block requests that are declared as threats, that is, their Violation Rating is 4 or 5. It is possible to change this behavior: either disable enforcement by Violation Rating or block also request with Violation Rating 3 - needs examination. See section on [basic configuration](#policy-configuration) below. |
|Request size checks | Upper limit of request size as dictated by the maximum buffer size of 10 MB;  Size checks for: URL, header, Query String, whole request (when smaller than the maximum buffer), cookie, POST data. By default all the checks are enabled with the exception of POST data and whole request. The user can enable or disable every check and customize the size limits. |
|Malformed cookie | Requests with cookies that are not RFC compliant are blocked by default. This can be disabled. |
