## Overview

F5 NGINX App Protect WAF provides web application firewall (WAF) security protection for your web applications, including OWASP Top 10; response inspection; Meta characters check; HTTP protocol compliance; evasion techniques; disallowed file types; JSON & XML well-formedness; sensitive parameters & Data Guard. Refer to [Supported Security Policy Features]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/configuration-guide/configuration.md#supported-security-policy-features" >}}) section for a more detailed description.

This guide explains how to deploy NGINX App Protect WAF as well as upgrade App Protect and the App Protect signature sets.<br>

### Using NGINX App Protect with NGINX Instance Manager

NGINX Instance Manager provides centralized configuration management and visibility for your NGINX App Protect WAF fleet.
After completing the NGINX App Protect WAF installation, refer to the [NGINX Instance Manager Installation Guide](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-instance-manager/deploy/) for the deployment instructions.  

## Prerequisites

NGINX App Protect WAF is available to customers as a downloadable dynamic module at an additional cost. To purchase or add NGINX App Protect WAF to an existing NGINX Plus subscription, contact the NGINX sales team.

NGINX Plus Release 22 and later supports NGINX App Protect WAF.

NGINX App Protect WAF supports the following operating systems:

- [Alpine 3.19](#alpine-installation)
- [Amazon Linux 2023](#amazon-linux-installation)
- [Debian 11 (Bullseye) & 12 (Bookworm)](#debian-10--debian-11--debian-12-installation)
- [Oracle Linux 8.1.x and above](#oracle-linux-81-installation)
- [RHEL 8.1.x and above](#rhel-81-installation)
- [RHEL 9 and above](#rhel-9-installation)
- [Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal), 22.04 (Jammy) & 24.04 (Noble)](#ubuntu-installation)

The NGINX App Protect WAF package has the following dependencies:

1. **nginx-plus-module-appprotect** - NGINX Plus dynamic module for App Protect
1. **app-protect-engine** - The App Protect enforcement engine
1. **app-protect-plugin** - The App Protect connector API between the engine and the NGINX Plus dynamic module
1. **app-protect-compiler** - The App Protect enforcement engine compiler agent
1. **app-protect-common** - The App Protect shared libraries package
1. **app-protect-geoip** - The App Protect geolocation update package
1. **app-protect-graphql** - The App Protect shared library package for GraphQL protection
1. **app-protect-attack-signatures** - The App Protect attack signatures update package
1. **app-protect-threat-campaigns** - The App Protect threat campaigns update package
1. **app-protect-bot-signatures** - The App Protect bot signatures update package
1. **app-protect-selinux** - The prebuilt SELinux policy module for NGINX App Protect WAF (optional dependency)

See the NGINX Plus full list of prerequisites for more details. NGINX App Protect WAF can be installed as a module to an existing NGINX Plus installation or as a complete NGINX Plus with App Protect installation in a clean environment.

## Storage I/O Performance

When deploying App Protect on NGINX Plus take into consideration the performance of storage on which it is going to be installed.
The storage performance may greatly affect the time it takes NGINX Plus to reload whenever there is a configuration change, especially when NGINX App Protect WAF policies are being added or updated.
In order to assess the storage performance you can use a tool called [fio](https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fio_doc.html). An example of usage follows: (you may need to use `sudo`):

```shell
fio --filename=/opt/tst --size=100MB --direct=1 --rw=randrw --bs=4k --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=256 --runtime=120 --numjobs=4 --time_based --group_reporting --name=iops-test-job --eta-newline=1
```

The output fields relevant in this context are: `read: IOPS=` and `write: IOPS=`.
Below is a table showing how many seconds it takes a reload to complete, when NGINX Plus is reloaded with an updated policy of an average size, in environments of varying I/O performance, and comparable CPU/memory specs:

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
|Read IOPS | Write IOPS | Reload Time|
| ---| ---| --- |
|675 | 678 | 18 |
|1575 | 1575 | 12 |
|13400 | 13400 | 8 |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}

## Platform Security Considerations

When deploying App Protect on NGINX Plus take the following precautions to secure the platform. This avoids the risk of causing a Denial of Service condition or compromising the platform security.

- Restrict permissions to the files on the NGINX App Protect WAF platform to user **nginx** and group **nginx**, especially for the sensitive areas containing the configuration.
- Remove unnecessary remote access services on the platform.
- Configure a Syslog destination on the same machine as App Protect and proxy to an external destination. This avoids eavesdropping and [man-in-the-middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attacks on the Syslog channel.
- Regularly update the Operating System (OS) to avoid known OS vulnerabilities which may impact the service.


## User Permissions

If a user other than **nginx** is to be used, note the following:

- If **nginx** user creation is disallowed on the platform, the following warning may be seen during installation:

  ```shell
  warning: user nginx does not exist - using root
  ```

- After first installation, upgrade, or security update installation, perform the following steps **before** starting/restarting/reloading NGINX:

  - Modify user permissions on all installed NGINX App Protect WAF files:

    ```shell
    chown -R <user>:<group> /usr/share/ts /var/log/app_protect /opt/app_protect /etc/app_protect
    ```

  - Modify user of NGINX App Protect WAF processes:

    For service startup modify the **User** in the following files on your platform:

    `nginx-app-protect.service`

    For [docker deployment](#general-docker-deployment-instructions), modify the `entrypoint.sh` script to use the correct user instead of **nginx** when starting up the `bd-socket-plugin` process.

## Alpine Installation

1. If you already have NGINX packages in your system, back up your configs and logs:

    ```shell
    sudo cp -a /etc/nginx /etc/nginx-plus-backup
    sudo cp -a /var/log/nginx /var/log/nginx-plus-backup
    ```

2. Log in to the [Customer Portal](https://my.f5.com) and download the following two files:

    ```shell
    nginx-repo.key
    nginx-repo.crt
    ```

3. Upload `nginx-repo.key` to `/etc/apk/cert.key` and `nginx-repo.crt` to `/etc/apk/cert.pem`. Make sure that files do not contain other certificates and keys, as Alpine Linux does not support mixing client certificates for different repositories.

4. Add the NGINX public signing key to the directory `/etc/apk/keys`:

    ```shell
    sudo wget -O /etc/apk/keys/nginx_signing.rsa.pub  https://cs.nginx.com/static/keys/nginx_signing.rsa.pub

    sudo wget -O /etc/apk/keys/app-protect-security-updates.rsa.pub https://cs.nginx.com/static/keys/app-protect-security-updates.rsa.pub
    ```

5. Remove any previously configured NGINX Plus repository:

    ```shell
    sed "/plus-pkgs.nginx.com/d" /etc/apk/repositories
    ```

6. Add the NGINX Plus repository to `/etc/apk/repositories` file:

    ```shell
    printf "https://pkgs.nginx.com/plus/alpine/v`egrep -o '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' /etc/alpine-release`/main\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/apk/repositories
    ```

7. Add the NGINX App Protect WAF repository to `/etc/apk/repositories` file:

    ```shell
    printf "https://pkgs.nginx.com/app-protect/alpine/v`egrep -o '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' /etc/alpine-release`/main\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/apk/repositories

    printf "https://pkgs.nginx.com/app-protect-security-updates/alpine/v`egrep -o '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' /etc/alpine-release`/main\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/apk/repositories
    ```

8. We recommend removing all community-supported NGINX packages. Note that all NGINX modules will be removed as well.

    ```shell
    sudo apk del -r app-protect
    sudo apk del -r nginx
    ```

9. Update the repository and install the most recent version of the NGINX Plus and NGINX App Protect WAF:

    ```shell
    sudo apk update
    sudo apk add app-protect
    ```

    Alternatively, use the following commands to install the most recent version of NGINX App Protect WAF for NGINX Plus R28:

    ```shell
    sudo apk update
    sudo apk add app-protect
    ```

    Alternatively, use the following commands to list available versions:

    ```shell
    sudo apk update
    sudo apk info app-protect
    ```

    Finally, install a specific version from the output of command above. For example:

    ```shell
    sudo apk add app-protect=30.4.457.0-r1
    ```

10. Check the NGINX binary version to ensure that you have NGINX Plus installed correctly:

    ```shell
    sudo nginx -v
    ```

11. Load the NGINX App Protect WAF module on the main context in the `nginx.conf` file:

    ```nginx
    load_module modules/ngx_http_app_protect_module.so;
    ```

12. Enable NGINX App Protect WAF on an `http/server/location` context in the `nginx.conf` via:

    ```nginx
    app_protect_enable on;
    ```

13. Start the App Protect and NGINX services:

    ```shell
    sudo service nginx-app-protect start
    sudo service nginx start
    ```

    ```shell
    sudo dnf install app-protect-selinux
    ```

    If you encounter any issues, check the [Troubleshooting Guide]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/troubleshooting-guide/troubleshooting#selinux" >}}).

15. To enable the NGINX/App Protect WAF service start at boot, run the command:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl enable nginx.service
    ```

16. Start the NGINX service:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    ```

## Ubuntu Installation

1. If you already have NGINX packages in your system, back up your configs and logs:

    ```shell
    sudo cp -a /etc/nginx /etc/nginx-plus-backup
    sudo cp -a /var/log/nginx /var/log/nginx-plus-backup
    ```

2. Create the `/etc/ssl/nginx/` directory:

    ```shell
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/nginx
    ```

3. Log in to the [Customer Portal](https://my.f5.com) and download the following two files:

    ```shell
    nginx-repo.key
    nginx-repo.crt
    ```

4. Copy the above two files to the Ubuntu server's `/etc/ssl/nginx/` directory. Use an SCP client or another secure file transfer tool to perform this task.

5. Install prerequisite packages:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates wget gnupg2
    ```

6. Download and add the NGINX signing keys:

    ```shell
    wget -qO - https://cs.nginx.com/static/keys/nginx_signing.key | \
    gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/nginx-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null

    wget -qO - https://cs.nginx.com/static/keys/app-protect-security-updates.key | \
    gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/app-protect-security-updates.gpg >/dev/null
    ```

7. Remove any previous NGINX Plus repository and apt configuration files:

    ```shell
    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx-plus.list
    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*app-protect*.list
    sudo rm /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90pkgs-nginx
    ```

8. Add NGINX Plus repository:

    ```shell
    printf "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nginx-archive-keyring.gpg] \
    https://pkgs.nginx.com/plus/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` nginx-plus\n" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx-plus.list
    ```

9. Add NGINX App Protect WAF repositories:

    ```shell
    printf "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nginx-archive-keyring.gpg] \
    https://pkgs.nginx.com/app-protect/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` nginx-plus\n" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx-app-protect.list

    printf "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/app-protect-security-updates.gpg] \
    https://pkgs.nginx.com/app-protect-security-updates/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` nginx-plus\n" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/app-protect-security-updates.list
    ```

10. Download the apt configuration to `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d`:

    ```shell
    sudo wget -P /etc/apt/apt.conf.d https://cs.nginx.com/static/files/90pkgs-nginx
    ```

11. Update the repository and install the most recent version of the NGINX App Protect WAF package (which includes NGINX Plus):

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install app-protect
    ```

    Alternatively, to install a specific version, use the following commands to update and list available versions:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-cache policy app-protect
    ```

    Finally, install a specific version from the output of command above. For example:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install -y app-protect-compiler=5.9.4-1~[OS_CODENAME] \
    app-protect-plugin=3.263.0-1~[OS_CODENAME] \
    nginx-plus-module-appprotect=23+3.263.0-1~[OS_CODENAME] \
    app-protect-engine=5.9.4-1~[OS_CODENAME] \
    app-protect=23+3.263.0-1~[OS_CODENAME]
    ```

    Replace the [OS_CODENAME] in above the example with **focal** for Ubuntu 20.04, **jammy** for Ubuntu 22.04 and **noble** for Ubuntu 24.04.
    <br>
    <br>

    {{< note >}} When installing an older version of NGINX App Protect WAF, the dependent packages have to be installed manually, as shown in the command above. The following script can be used to find out the dependent packages for a specific version of NGINX App Protect WAF.{{< /note >}}

    ```shell
    findDeps () { local pkgs=$(apt show $1 2>/dev/null | grep Depends: | grep -oE "(nginx-plus-module|app-protect)-[a-z]+ *\(= *[0-9\+\.-]+~`lsb_release -cs`\)" | tr -d ' ()'); for p in ${pkgs[@]}; do echo $p; findDeps $p; done; }
    findDeps app-protect=23+3.263.0-1~[OS_CODENAME]
    ```

12. Check the NGINX binary version to ensure that you have NGINX Plus installed correctly:

    ```shell
    sudo nginx -v
    ```

13. Load the NGINX App Protect WAF module on the main context in the `nginx.conf` file:

    ```nginx
    load_module modules/ngx_http_app_protect_module.so;
    ```

14. Enable NGINX App Protect WAF on an `http/server/location` context in the `nginx.conf` via:

    ```nginx
    app_protect_enable on;
    ```

15. Start the NGINX service:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    ```

{{< note >}} Ubuntu 20.04 / Ubuntu 22.04 / Ubuntu 24.04 activates **AppArmor** by default, but NGINX App Protect WAF will run in unconfined mode after being installed as it is shipped with no AppArmor profile. To benefit from AppArmor access control capabilities for NGINX App Protect WAF, you will have to write your own AppArmor profile for NGINX App Protect WAF executables found in `/opt/app_protect/bin` such that it best suits your environment.
{{< /note >}}

## Docker Deployments

### Common instructions

1. Create a Dockerfile (see examples below) which copies the following files into the docker image:

   - `nginx.conf`: User defined nginx.conf with app-protect enabled
   - `entrypoint.sh`: Docker startup script which spins up all App Protect processes, must have executable permissions
   - `custom_log_format.json`: Optional user-defined security log format file (if not used - remove its references from the `nginx.conf` and Dockerfile)

2. Log in to the [Customer Portal](https://my.f5.com) and download the following two files:

    ```shell
    nginx-repo.key
    nginx-repo.crt
    ```

3. Copy the files to the directory where the Dockerfile is located.

4. Optionally, create `custom_log_format.json` in the same directory, for example:

    ```json
    {
        "filter": {
            "request_type": "all"
        },
        "content": {
            "format": "splunk",
            "max_request_size": "any",
            "max_message_size": "10k"
        }
    }
    ```

5. In the same directory create an `nginx.conf` file with the following contents:

    ```nginx
    user nginx;

    worker_processes auto;
    load_module modules/ngx_http_app_protect_module.so;

    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log debug;

    events {
        worker_connections 10240;
    }

    http {
        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
        default_type application/octet-stream;
        sendfile on;
        keepalive_timeout 65;

        upstream app_backend_com {
            server 192.168.0.1:8000;
            server 192.168.0.1:8001;
        }
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name app.example.com;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;

            app_protect_enable on;
            app_protect_security_log_enable on;
            app_protect_security_log "/etc/nginx/custom_log_format.json" syslog:server=127.0.0.1:514;

            location / {
                client_max_body_size 0;
                default_type text/html;
                # set your backend here
                proxy_pass http://app_backend_com;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    {{< important >}}Make sure to replace upstream and proxy pass directives in this example with relevant application backend settings.{{< /important >}}
6. In the same directory create an `entrypoint.sh` file with the following content:

    ```shell
    #!/bin/sh

    /bin/su -s /bin/sh -c "/usr/share/ts/bin/bd-socket-plugin tmm_count 4 proc_cpuinfo_cpu_mhz 2000000 total_xml_memory 307200000 total_umu_max_size 3129344 sys_max_account_id 1024 no_static_config 2>&1 >> /var/log/app_protect/bd-socket-plugin.log &" nginx
    /usr/sbin/nginx -g 'daemon off;'
    ```

7. Create a Docker image:

    - For Oracle Linux/Debian/Ubuntu/Alpine/Amazon Linux:

        ```shell
        DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --no-cache --secret id=nginx-crt,src=nginx-repo.crt --secret id=nginx-key,src=nginx-repo.key -t app-protect .
        ```

        The `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` enables `docker build` to recognize the `--secret` flag which allows the user to pass secret information to be used in the Dockerfile for building docker images in a safe way that will not end up stored in the final image. This is a recommended practice for the handling of the certificate and private key for NGINX repository access (`nginx-repo.crt` and `nginx-repo.key` files). More information [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#secret).

    - For RHEL:

        ```shell
        podman build --no-cache --secret id=nginx-crt,src=nginx-repo.crt --secret id=nginx-key,src=nginx-repo.key -t app-protect .
        ```

    **Notes:**
    - The `--no-cache` option tells Docker/Podman to build the image from scratch and ensures the installation of the latest version of NGINX Plus and NGINX App Protect WAF 4.x. If the Dockerfile was previously used to build an image without the `--no-cache` option, the new image uses versions from the previously built image from the cache.
    - For RHEL:<br>
    The subscription-manager is disabled when running inside containers based on Red Hat Universal Base images. You will need a registered and subscribed RHEL system.

8. Verify that the app-protect image was created successfully with the docker images command:

    ```shell
    docker images app-protect
    ```

9. Create a container based on this image, for example, my-app-protect container:

    ```shell
    docker run --name my-app-protect -p 80:80 -d app-protect
    ```

10. Verify that the my-app-protect container is up and running with the `docker ps` command:

    ```shell
    docker ps
    ```

## Converter Tool Docker Image

This section explains how to build a Docker image for the purpose of converting policy files from other F5 WAF products to NGINX App Protect WAF JSON declarative format.
For more details regarding this feature refer to [Converter Tools]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/configuration-guide/configuration.md#converter-tools" >}}).

### Converter Docker Deployment Instructions
You need root permissions to execute the following steps.

1. Create a Dockerfile (see examples below).

2. Log in to the [Customer Portal](https://my.f5.com) and download the following two files:

    ```shell
    nginx-repo.key
    nginx-repo.crt
    ```

3. Create a Docker image:

    - For Oracle Linux/Debian/Ubuntu/Alpine/Amazon Linux:

        ```shell
        DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --no-cache --secret id=nginx-crt,src=nginx-repo.crt --secret id=nginx-key,src=nginx-repo.key -t app-protect-converter .
        ```

        The `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` enables `docker build` to recognize the `--secret` flag which allows the user to pass secret information to be used in the Dockerfile for building docker images in a safe way that will not end up stored in the final image. This is a recommended practice for the handling of the certificate and private key for NGINX repository access (`nginx-repo.crt` and `nginx-repo.key` files). More information [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#secret).

    - For RHEL:

        ```shell
        podman build --no-cache --secret id=nginx-crt,src=nginx-repo.crt --secret id=nginx-key,src=nginx-repo.key -t app-protect-converter .
        ```

    **Notes:**
    - The `--no-cache` option tells Docker/Podman to build the image from scratch and ensures the installation of the latest version of NGINX Plus and NGINX App Protect WAF 4.x. If the Dockerfile was previously used to build an image without the `--no-cache` option, the new image uses versions from the previously built image from the cache.
    - For RHEL:<br>
    The subscription-manager is disabled when running inside containers based on Red Hat Universal Base images. You will need a registered and subscribed RHEL system.

4. Create a temporary folder and copy your XML policy file(s) to it:

    ```shell
    mkdir /tmp/convert
    cp policy.xml /tmp/convert/
    ```

5. Run the docker image with the temporary folder as a mounted volume on the container, and run the policy converter script:

    ```shell
    docker run -v /tmp/convert:/tmp/convert app-protect-converter /opt/app_protect/bin/convert-policy -i /tmp/convert/policy.xml -o /tmp/convert/policy.json | jq
    ```

    Output:

    ```json

    ```

6. Once completed, the newly exported JSON policy file should reside in the same folder as the source XML policy file:

    ```shell
    ls -l /tmp/convert/
    total 848
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  20604 Dec 20 12:33 policy.json    # Exported JSON policy file
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 841818 Dec 20 11:10 policy.xml     # Original XML policy file
    ```

## Post-Installation Checks

You can run the following commands to ensure that NGINX App Protect WAF enforcement is operational.

1. Check that the three processes needed for NGINX App Protect WAF are running using `ps aux`:
    - bd-socket-plugin
    - nginx: master process
    - nginx: worker process

    ```none
    USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    root         8  1.3  2.4 3486948 399092 ?      Sl   09:11   0:02 /usr/share/ts/bin/bd-socket-plugin tmm_count 4 proc_cpuinfo_cpu_mhz 2000000 total_xml_memory 307200000 total_umu_max_size 3129344 sys_max_account_id 1024 no_static_config

    ```

2. Verify that there are no NGINX errors in the `/var/log/nginx/error.log` and that the policy compiled successfully:

    ```none

3. Check that sending an attack signature in a request returns a response block page containing a support ID:

    ```none
    Request:
    http://10.240.185.211/?a=<script>

    Response:
    The requested URL was rejected. Please consult with your administrator.

    Your support ID is: 9847191526422998597

    [Go Back]
    ```

4. In case your policy includes JSON/XML profiles, please check `/var/log/app_protect/bd-socket-plugin.log` and make sure there aren't any errors by running:

    ```none
    grep '|ERR' /var/log/app_protect/bd-socket-plugin.log
    ```

    If you see an error similar to:

    ```none
    ... Cannot allocate 196744 more bytes for XML parser. current memory size 307089520 (in bytes) ...
    ```

    Increase the `bd-socket-plugin` process command line variable `total_xml_memory` in the `startup.sh` script or in the `nginx-app-protect.service` file.

    The NGINX App Protect's unit file can be modified with the following command:

    ```none
    sudo systemctl edit --full nginx-app-protect.service
    ```

    The file itself is located at `/lib/systemd/system/` in deb packages, at `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` in rpm
    packages.

    The number `471859200` should be enough for most use cases, you may need to use a bigger number if the number of profiles is large, or large json/xml schemas are used in the policy.

5. If there are additional problems, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/troubleshooting-guide/troubleshooting#app-protect-troubleshooting-overview" >}}).


## Attack Signatures Dependency Change in NGINX App Protect WAF

Starting with release 3.12 there is a change in dependency of the Attack Signatures package. Until release 3.11, NGINX App Protect WAF used pre-packaged Attack Signatures that did not provide the latest Attack Signatures. <br>

From version 3.12, when the user performs the clean install (installing NGINX App Protect WAF for the first time), it will install the latest Attack Signatures package. This will keep the customers up to date with the latest Attack Signatures and provide protection against the latest threats. <br>

The way to achieve the goal of better protection will use the package dependency mechanism so the app protect package will be dependent on the signatures package thus ensuring that the latest signatures package is deployed once the app protect release is deployed for the first time.<br>

In case the user has an older version of NGINX App Protect WAF and never installed the Attack Signatures package, upgrading NGINX App Protect WAF will install the latest Attack Signatures. However, if they have installed Attack Signatures package previously at any point in time, NGINX App Protect WAF will not install the latest Attack Signatures.

{{< note >}}The user can upgrade or downgrade the Attack Signatures regardless of the installed version of NGINX App Protect WAF.{{< /note >}}

### Attack Signatures Package
The attack signature package is named: app-protect-attack-signatures-2022.08.04. The version number for this package reflects the date the package was released. The format is: _YYYY.MM.DD_ where:

- YYYY is the 4-digit year
- MM is the month
- DD is the day in the month

Example: app-protect-attack-signatures-2022.08.04

## Updating App Protect Attack Signatures

Attack Signatures updates are released at higher frequency than App Protect, therefore they are released in their own package, separate from the App Protect package. You can update the attack signatures without updating the App Protect release, and conversely, you can update App Protect without changing the attack signature package, unless you move to a new NGINX Plus release.

### Installing Attack Signature Update

After having updated the Attack Signature package you have to reload the configuration in order for the new version of the Signatures to take effect. Until then App Protect will run with the old version. That is useful when creating an environment with a specific tested version of the Attack Signatures.

### Attack Signatures When Upgrading NGINX App Protect WAF

Upgrading App Protect does _not_ install new Attack Signatures. You will get the same Attack Signature release after upgrading App Protect. If you want to also upgrade the Attack Signatures, you will have to explicitly update them by the respective command above.

### Threat Campaigns Dependency Change in NGINX App Protect WAF

Starting with release 3.12 there is a change in dependency of the Threat Campaigns package. Until release 3.11, App Protect installation did not come with a built-in Threat Campaigns package like Attack Signatures. <br>

From version 3.12, when the user performs the clean install (installing NGINX App Protect WAF for the first time), it will install the latest Threat Campaigns package. This will keep the customers up to date with the latest Threat Campaigns and provide protection against the latest threats. <br>

The way to achieve the goal of better protection will use the package dependency mechanism so the app protect package will be dependent on the Threat Campaigns package thus ensuring that the latest Threat Campaigns package is deployed once the app protect release is deployed for the first time.<br>

In case the user has an older version of NGINX App Protect WAF and never installed the Threat Campaigns package, upgrading NGINX App Protect will install the latest Threat Campaigns. However, if they have installed Threat Campaigns package previously at any point in time, NGINX App Protect WAF will not install the latest Threat Campaigns.

{{< note >}}The user can upgrade or downgrade the Threat Campaigns regardless of the installed version of NGINX App Protect WAF.{{< /note >}}

### Installing Threat Campaigns Update

Until release 3.11 App Protect installation did not come with a built-in Threat Campaigns package like Attack Signatures. Threat Campaigns Updates are released periodically whenever new campaigns and vectors are discovered, so you might want to update your Threat Campaigns from time to time. You can upgrade the Threat Campaigns by updating the package any time after installing App Protect. We recommend you upgrade to the latest Threat Campaigns version right after installing App Protect.

After having updated the Threat Campaigns package you have to reload the configuration in order for the new version of the Threat Campaigns to take effect. Until then App Protect will run with the old version, if one exists. This is useful when creating an environment with a specific tested version of the Threat Campaigns.

## Updating App Protect Threat Campaigns

The Threat Campaigns feature is described [here]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/configuration-guide/configuration.md#threat-campaigns" >}}).

## Upgrading App Protect

You can upgrade to the latest NGINX Plus and App Protect 4.x versions by downloading and installing the latest NGINX App Protect WAF 4.x package. When upgrading from this package, App Protect will be uninstalled and reinstalled. The old default security policy is deleted and the new default security policy is installed. If you have created a custom security policy, the policy persists and you will need to update `nginx.conf` and point to the custom security policy by referencing the json file (using the full path).

After upgrading the NGINX App Protect WAF version, restart NGINX manually:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Upgrading App Protect to the latest version

### RHEL 8.1+ / RHEL 9+ / Oracle Linux 8.1+ 

Upgrade the NGINX App Protect WAF to the latest 4.x version:

```shell
sudo dnf -y update app-protect
```

### Debian 11 / Debian 12 / Ubuntu 20.04 / Ubuntu 22.04

## SELinux Configuration

The default settings for Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) on modern Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and related distros can be very strict, erring on the side of security rather than convenience.

Although the NGINX App Protect WAF provides an optional package with prebuilt SELinux policy module - `app-protect-selinux`, your specific configuration might be blocked unless you adjust the policy or modify file labels.

### Modifying File Labels

For example, if you plan to store your security policy files in `/etc/security_policies` - you should change the default SELinux file context for this directory:

```shell
semanage fcontext -a -t nap-compiler_conf_t /etc/security_policies
restorecon -Rv /etc/security_policies
```

### Syslog to Custom Port

If you want to send logs to some unreserved port, you can use `semanage` to add the desired port (here, 35514) to the syslogd_port_t type:

```shell
semanage port -a -t syslogd_port_t -p tcp 35514
```

Review the syslog ports by entering the following command:

```shell
semanage port -l | grep syslog
```

If there are additional problems, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/troubleshooting-guide/troubleshooting#selinux" >}}).
