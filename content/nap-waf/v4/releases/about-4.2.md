### Resolved Issues

- 7411 Fixed - The Protocol Buffers library has been updated to enable the usage of keywords that were previously unsupported in gRPC IDL files.

- 7986 Fixed - When converting a policy from BIG-IP, collections with wildcardOrder, such as "urls", may result with the default "*" element being in the wrong order relative to the other wildcard entries. This lead to unexpected and incorrect policy enforcement.
convert-policy now writes these elements in the correct order. Importing a policy with an unexpected order also works as expected.

- 7939 Fixed - Requests blocked due to `VIOL_ATTACK_SIGNATURE` although all signatures disabled.

- 7199 Fixed - Alignment of notification and availability of NGINX App Protect Signature updates.


### **Important Note**

- This release introduces a change in the package dependencies for NGINX App Protect WAF. Customers who work in a SELinux-enforced environment should now explicitly list `app-protect-selinux` package when performing App Protect clean install and upgrade.<br><br>
NGINX App Protect WAF’s SELinux module is now an optional package (meaning -  **not included in default installation**). In order to install `app-protect` with `app-protect-selinux` package, use the following command:<br>

  ```shell
  yum install app-protect app-protect-selinux
  ```
