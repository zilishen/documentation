Stay up-to-date with what's new and improved in the F5 NGINX One Console.

## April 3, 2025

### Create Custom Roles with more precise permissions

We have added API groups that align with the features and functionality in the NGINX One Console. You can now:

- Use our narrowly scoped API groups.
- Tailor access policies with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/administration/how-tos/user-mgmt/roles#custom-roles).

#### Highlights:

- Custom role assignments: You can set up custom roles for users or service accounts.
- Namespace-based permissions: With [namespaces](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/platform/concepts/core-concepts#namespaces), you can configure API group permissions to support least privilege.

For more information, read [Custom roles and API groups]({{< ref "/nginx-one/rbac/rbac-api.md" >}}).

### Set up Staged Configurations

It allows you to:

- Save Your Progress: Staged Configurations allow you to work on configuration changes without the need for a fully functional setup. You can create these drafts from scratch, an existing Instance, another Staged Configuration, or a Config Sync Group.
- No Immediate Validation Required: You don't have to immediately address syntax or configuration issues. Your Staged Configuration doesn't have to be valid until you publish it to an Instance or a Config Sync Group.
- Manage through our API: You can easily manage your Staged Configurations programmatically through our [API]({{< ref "/nginx-one/api/api-reference-guide/#tag/StagedConfigs" >}}).

### Manage certificates with Config Sync Groups

With the NGINX One Console, you can now manage certificate deployment in Config Sync Groups.

You can:

- Add a certificate to a Config Sync Group
- Remove a deployed certificate from a Config Sync Group

For more information, including warnings about risks, see our documentation on how you can:
- [Add a file]({{< ref "/nginx-one/how-to/nginx-configs/add-file.md" >}})
- [Manage certificates]({{< ref "/nginx-one/how-to/certificates/manage-certificates.md" >}})

### Revert a configuration

Using the NGINX One Console you can now:

- See a history of changes to the configuration on an instance or a Config Sync Group, as well as the content of the previous five configs published to that object
- Review the differences between the current and other saved configurations
- Revert to older configurations as needed

### AI Assistant

In the F5 NGINX One Console, you can now select lines from your configuration files, and then select **Explain with AI**. The NGINX One AI Assistant explains those lines based on the official NGINX documentation.

## November 7, 2024

### Certificates

From the NGINX One Console you can now:

- Monitor all certificates configured for use by your connected NGINX Instances.
- Ensure that your certificates are current and correct.
- Manage your certificates from a central location. This can help you simplify operations and remotely update, rotate, and deploy those certificates.

For more information, see the full documentation on how you can [Manage Certificates]({{< ref "/nginx-one/how-to/certificates/manage-certificates.md" >}}).

## August 22, 2024

### Config Sync Groups

Config Sync Groups are now available in the F5 NGINX One Console. This feature allows you to manage and synchronize NGINX configurations across multiple instances as a single entity, ensuring consistency and simplifying the management of your NGINX environment.

For more information, see the full documentation on [Managing Config Sync Groups]({{< ref "/nginx-one/how-to/config-sync-groups/manage-config-sync-groups.md" >}}).

## August 8, 2024

### Instance object cleanup

NGINX Instance objects that have been `unavailable` for a set period will be automatically cleaned up (deleted). By default, this period is 24 hours from the time the NGINX Instance object was last updated. An administrator can change or disable the cleanup process in the "Instance Settings" under Settings. Events will be generated for NGINX Instances that have been automatically cleaned up. See "Events" for a list of NGINX Instances that have been deleted automatically.

## June 11, 2024

### View NGINX security vulnerabilities (CVEs)

You can now view NGINX CVEs on the **Security** page. The listed CVEs affect official releases of NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus.

Select the link for each CVE to see the details, including the CVE's publish date, severity, description, and the affected NGINX products and instances.

## May 29, 2024

### Edit NGINX configurations

You can now make configuration changes to your NGINX instances. For more details, see [View and edit NGINX configurations]({{< ref "/nginx-one/how-to/nginx-configs/view-edit-nginx-configurations.md" >}}).

### Improved data plane key and NGINX instance navigation

We've updated the **Instance Details** and **Data Plane Keys** pages to make it easier to go between keys and registered instances.

- On the **Instance Details** page, you can now find a link to the instance's data plane key. Select the "Data Plane Key" link to view important details like status, expiration, and other registered instances.
- The **Data Plane Keys** page now includes links to more information about each data plane key.

## February 28, 2024

### Breaking change

- API responses now use "object_id" instead of "uuid". For example, **key_1mp6W5pqRxSZJugJN-yA8g**. We've introduced specific prefixes for different types of objects:
  - Use **key\_** for data-plane keys.
  - Use **inst\_** for NGINX instances.
  - Use **nc\_** for NGINX configurations.
- Likewise, we've updated the JSON key from **uuid** to **object_id** in response objects.
