## Overview

This guide explains how you can manage SSL/TLS certificates with the F5 NGINX One Console. Valid certificates support encrypted connections between NGINX and your users.

You may have separate sets of SSL/TLS certificates, as described in the following table:

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Functionality     | Typical file names                                                 | Notes                                                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Website traffic   | /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.crt <br> /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.key | Typically purchased from a Certificate Authority (CA)                                 |
| Repository access | /etc/ssl/nginx/nginx-repo.crt <br> /etc/ssl/nginx/nginx-repo.key   | Supports access to repositories to download and install NGINX packages                |
| NGINX Licensing   | /etc/ssl/nginx/server.crt <br> /etc/ssl/nginx/server.key   | Supports access to repositories. Based on licenses downloaded from https://my.f5.com/ |
{{</bootstrap-table>}}

Allowed directories depend on the [NGINX Agent]({{< ref "/nginx-one/getting-started/#install-nginx-agent" >}}). Look for the `/etc/nginx-agent/nginx-agent.conf` file.
Find the `config_dirs` parameter in that file, as described in the NGINX Agent [Basic configuration](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-agent/configuration/configuration-overview/#cli-flags--environment-variables).
You may need to add a directory like `/etc/ssl` to that parameter.

From the NGINX One Console you can:

- Monitor all certificates configured for use by your connected NGINX Instances.
- Ensure that your certificates are current and correct.
- Manage your certificates from a central location. This can help you simplify operations and remotely update, rotate, and deploy those certificates.

You can manage the certificates for:

- [Unique instances]({{< ref "/nginx-one/how-to/nginx-configs/add-file.md#new-ssl-certificate-or-ca-bundle" >}})
- For all instances that are members of a [Config Sync Group]({{< ref "/nginx-one/how-to/config-sync-groups/manage-config-sync-groups/#configuration-management" >}})


{{< tip >}}

If you are managing the certificate from NGINX One Console, we recommend that you avoid directly manipulating the files on the data plane.

## Before you start

Before you add and manage certificates with the NGINX One Console make sure:

- You have access to the NGINX One Console
- You have access through the F5 Distributed Cloud role, as described in the [Authentication]({{< ref "/nginx-one/api/authentication.md" >}}) guide, to manage SSL/TLS certificates
  - You have the `f5xc-nginx-one-user` role for your account
- Your SSL/TLS certificates and keys match

### SSL/TLS certificates and more

NGINX One Console supports certificates for access to repositories. You may need a copy of these files from your Certificate Authority (CA)  to upload them to NGINX One Console:

- SSL Certificate
  - Example file extensions: .crt, .pem
- Privacy certificate
  - Example file extensions: .key, .pem

The NGINX One Console allows you to upload these certificates as text and as files. You can also upload your own certificate files (with file extensions such as .crt and .key).

Make sure your certificates, keys, and pem files are encrypted to one of the following standards:

- RSA
- ECC/ECDSA

In other words, any private key of this type should be supported, regardless of the curve types or hashing algorithm.

For exmaple, if you use ECDSA private keys in PEM format, the PEM headers should contain:

```
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
<BASE64 ENCODED KEY>
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

```

If you use one of these keys, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, in [Publication 800-57 Part 3 (PDF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57Pt3r1.pdf), recommends a key size of at least
2048 bits. It also has recommnedations for ECDSA.

### Include certificates in NGINX configuration

For NGINX configuration, these files are typically associated with the following NGINX directives:

- [`ssl_certificate`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_ssl_module.html#ssl_certificate)
- [`ssl_certificate_key`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_ssl_module.html#ssl_certificate_key)
- [`ssl_trusted_certificate`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_ssl_module.html#ssl_trusted_certificate)
- [`ssl_client_certificate`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_client_certificate)
- [`proxy_ssl_certificate`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_ssl_certificate)
- [`proxy_ssl_certificate_key`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_ssl_certificate_key)

## Important considerations

Most websites include valid information from public keys and certificates or CA bundles. However, the NGINX One Console accepts, but provides warnings for these use cases:

- When the public certificate is expired
- When the leaf certificate part of a certificate chain is expired
- When any of the components of a CA bundle are expired
- When the public key does not match the private certificate

In such cases, you may get websites that present "Your connection is not private" warning messages in client web browsers.

## Review existing certificates

Follow these steps to review existing certificates for your instances.

On the left-hand pane, select **Certificates**. In the window that appears, you see:

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Term        | Definition |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Total** | Total number of certificates available to NGINX One Console |
| **Valid (31+ days)** | Number of certificates that expire in 31 or more days |
| **Expires Soon (<31 days)** | Number of certificates that expire in less than 31 days |
| **Expired** | Number of exprired certificates |
| **Not Ready** | Certificates with a start date in the future |
| **Managed** | Managed by and stored in the NGINX One Console |
| **Unmanaged** | Detected by, and not managed by NGINX One Console. To convert to managed, you may need to upload the certificate and key during the process. |
{{</bootstrap-table>}}

You can **Add Filter** to filter certificates by:

- Name
- Status
- Subject Name
- Type

The Export option supports exports of basic certification file information to a CSV file. It does _not_ include the content of the public certificate or the private key.

## Add a new certificate or bundle

To add a new certificate, select **Add Certificate**.

<!-- Candidate for an "include". Common content with add-file.md -->
In the screen that appears, you can add a certificate name. If you don't add a name, NGINX One will add a name for you, based on the expiration date for the certificate.

You can add certificates in the following formats:

- **SSL Certificate and Key**
- **CA Certificate Bundle**

In each case, you can upload files directly, or enter the content of the certificates in a text box. Once you upload these certificates, you'll see:

- **Certificate Details**, with the Subject Name, start and end dates.
- **Key Details**, with the encryption key size and algorithm, such as RSA
<!-- end potential "include" -->

## Edit an existing certificate or bundle

You can modify existing certificates from the **Certificates** screen. Select the certificate of your choice. Depending on the type of certificate, you'll then see either a **Edit Certificate** or **Edit CA Bundle** option. The NGINX One Console then presents a window with the same options as shown when you [Add a new certificate](#add-a-new-certificate-or-bundle).

If that certificate is already managed as part of a Config Sync Group, the changes you make affect all instances in that group.

## Remove a deployed certificate

You can remove a deployed certificate from an independent instance or from a Config Sync Group. This will remove the certificate's association with the instance or group, but it does not delete the certificate files from the instance(s).

Every instance with a deployed certificate includes paths to certificates in their configuration files. If you remove the deployed file path to one certificate, that change is limited to that one instance.

Every Config Sync Group also includes paths to certificates in its configuration files. If you remove the deployed path to one certificate, that change affects all instances which belong to that Config Sync Group.

## Delete a deployed certificate

To delete a certificate, find the name in the **Certificates** screen. Find the **Actions** column associated with the certificate. Select the ellipsis (`...`) and then select **Delete**. Before deleting that certificate, you should see a warning.

If that certificate is managed and is part of a Config Sync Group, that change affects all instances in that group.

{{< warning >}} Be cautious if you want to delete certificates that are being used by an instance or a Config Sync Group. Deleting such certificates leads to failure in affected NGINX deployments. {{< /warning >}}

## Managed and unmanaged certificates

If you register an instance to NGINX One Console, as described in [Add your NGINX instances to NGINX One]({{< ref "/nginx-one/getting-started.md#add-your-nginx-instances-to-nginx-one" >}}), and the associated SSL/TLS certificates:

- Are used in their NGINX configuration
- Do _not_ match an existing managed SSL certificate/CA bundle

These certificates appear in the list of unmanaged certificates.

We recommend that you convert your unmanaged certificates. Converting to a managed certificate allows you to centrally manage, update, and deploy a certificate to your data plane from the NGINX One Console.

To convert these cerificates to managed, start with the Certificates menu, and select **Unmanaged**. You should see a list of **Unmanaged Certificates or CA Bundles**. Then:

- Select a certificate
- Select **Convert to Managed**
- In the window that appears, you can now include the same information as shown in the [Add a new certificate](#add-a-new-certificate) section

<!-- Once you've completed the process, NGINX One reassigns this as a managed certificate, and assigns it to the associated instance or Config Sync Group. -->
