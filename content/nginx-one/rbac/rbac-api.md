Beyond the [Default roles]({{< ref "/nginx-one/rbac/roles.md" >}}) for NGINX One Console access, you can create [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/administration/how-tos/user-mgmt/roles#custom-roles) with more precisely defined access permissions.
You can assign custom roles to users or service accounts. You can associate these roles with specific namespaces, to help facilitate the principle of least privilege across your tenant.
For this use-case, we include a list of API groups that you can use to specify permissions for custom roles with more granular access controls to NGINX One Console APIs.

## F5 API groups for NGINX One

The following table lists the available API groups that you can use to construct a Role. These are narrowly scoped API groups that align with all the features and functionality within the NGINX One Console. These groups can help you create custom roles tailored to your specific needs.

{{< note >}}If you create custom roles using these API groups, users may not have access to all capabilities of the browser web portal.{{< /note >}}
