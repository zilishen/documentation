## 2.17.0
July 09, 2024

### {{% icon-bug %}} Web Analytics are not enabled after upgrading Instance Manager when keeping existing nms-http.conf {#45131}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 45131 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When using NGINX Instance Manager, you configure OIDC by manually editing the /etc/nginx/conf.d/nms-http.conf and /etc/nms/nms.conf files.

During the upgrade to 2.17.0, the user is asked if they would like to keep their own nms-http.conf, or replace it with the new default. As Web Analytics are enabled via the /etc/nginx/conf.d/nms-http.conf file, if a user decides to keep their own config when prompted during upgrade, these will not get enabled.

#### Workaround

To keep the existing nms-http.conf file while maintaining the web analytics functionality, add the following to "/etc/nginx/conf.d/nms-http.conf" , inside the `/ui` location block:

```text
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; block-all-mixed-content; frame-ancestors 'self'; object-src 'none'; manifest-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com s3.walkmeusercontent.com d3sbxpiag177w8.cloudfront.net data:; font-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com data: https://fonts.gstatic.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com; frame-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com blob:; worker-src 'self' blob: https://*.walkme.com;";

### {{% icon-bug %}} Failure to retrieve instance configuration when NAP-enabled instance doesn't register properly {#45113}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 45113 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
If NGINX Agent is configured to monitor NGINX App Protect before App Protect is installed, NGINX Agent will send an empty App Protect metadata structure to NGINX Instance Manager. This causes Instance Manager to fail to register the NGINX instance properly.

#### Workaround

Edit the "/etc/nginx-agent/nginx-agent.conf" file and configure "precompiled_publication" as "false". Then restart the nginx-agent process running `sudo systemctl restart nginx-agent`.

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Editing template submissions now allows for using most recent template version {#44971}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 44971 | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.17.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When editing a template submission, you can now choose between using a snapshot of the template from when it was first deployed or the latest version of the template. **Important:** Note that if you use the latest version, changes to the templates might make an augment template incompatible with a base template, causing the publication to the data plane to fail.

## 2.16.0
April 18, 2024

### {{% icon-resolved %}}  Editing template submissions uses the latest versions, may cause "malformed" errors {#44961}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 44961 | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.17.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When editing a template submission, the system currently uses the latest template files instead of the specific snapshot of files associated with the submission. The latest template files might not be well-formed and can cause errors when generating a configuration. This can lead to an error message saying "malformed."

#### Workaround

Use caution when editing template submissions. If you encounter a "malformed" error, check the template for any changes that could have caused the issue.

To keep a template from being changed accidentally, set it to "Ready for Use" by doing the following:

1. Go to **Templates**.
2. Find the template you want to lock and click the **Actions** button (three dots).
3. Select **Edit**.
4. Select the **Ready for Use** option.

If you need to modify a template that you have already submitted, create a copy instead of editing the original:

1. On the **Templates** page, locate the template you want to edit.
2. Select the **Actions** button and choose **Edit Template Files**.
3. Select **Save As** to duplicate the template, then give it a name.

## 2.15.0
December 12, 2023

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Unable to use NMS Predefined Log Profiles for NAP 4.7 {#44759}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 44759 | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.15.1   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
The predefined NGINX Management Suite Log Profiles are incompatible with NGINX App Protect 4.7.

#### Workaround

To use the NGINX Management Suite predefined log profiles with NGINX App Protect 4.7 follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the content of the NMS predefined log profile through the NMS Log Profile APIs, accessible in the (Manage WAF Security Policies and Security Log Profiles) section.
1. Decode the content obtained in the previous step using base64 encoding.
1. Modify the "max_request_size" and "max_message_size" values within the decoded content to the following:

    **"max_request_size": "2k", "max_message_size": "32k"**

1. Create a custom log profile using the NMS Log Profile APIs, incorporating the base64 encoded content from the adjusted configuration.
1. Update your NGINX configuration to reference the new custom log profile in the NGINX App Protect log profile directive.

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
Under certain conditions, instances that are not reporting request totals may not show in the Network Utilization panel or drawer when data is sorted by Request count. This typically happens when NGINX is not configured to stream metrics data to NGINX Agent.

#### Workaround

Configure NGINX Plus or NGINX Stub Status APIs to send correctly the NGINX metrics using NGINX Agent. See the [Metrics]({{< relref "nms/nim/about/overview-metrics.md" >}}) documentation to learn more.

## 2.13.0
August 28, 2023

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Access levels cannot be assigned to certain RBAC features {#44277}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 44277 | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.13.1   |

### {{% icon-bug %}} If you publish a configuration with an uncompiled policy, it will fail the first time {#44267}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 44267 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
In Instance Manager 2.13, a new configuration is published before the compile stage of a WAF policy is complete. This happens only when the policy is first referenced. This leads to a deployment failure, and the configuration rolls back. Typically, by the time you try to submit the configuration again, the policy has finished compiling, and the request goes through.

The initial failure message looks like this:

```text
Config push failed - err: failure from multiple instances. Affected placements: instance/70328a2c-699d-3a90-8548-b8fcec15dabd (instance-group: ig1) - err: failed building config payload: config: aux payload /etc/nms/NginxDefaultPolicy.tgz for instance:70328a2c-699d-3a90-8548-b8fcec15dabd not ready aux payload not ready, instance/2e637e08-64b3-36f9-8f47-b64517805e98 (instance-group: ig1) - err: failed building config payload: config: aux payload /etc/nms/NginxDefaultPolicy.tgz for instance:2e637e08-64b3-36f9-8f47-b64517805e98 not ready aux payload not ready
```

#### Workaround

Retry pushing the new configuration. The deployment should work the second time around.

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Validation errors in Resource Groups for certificates uploaded before 2.13 upgrade {#44254}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 44254 | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.13.1   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
If you upgrade to Instance Manager 2.13 and already have certificates in place, you may encounter validation errors in the web interface when you try to create or edit a Resource Group and access the Certs list. You will not be able to save the Resource Group if you encounter these errors.

This issue doesn't occur if you upload certificates _after_ upgrading to version 2.13, nor does it affect new 2.13 installations. Instance Groups and Systems are unaffected.

#### Workaround

To work around this issue, you have two options:

1. When creating or editing a Resource Group, don't use the Certs list. Instance Groups and Systems can still be used.
2. If you must use Resource Groups with Certs, delete any certificates that were uploaded before upgrading to 2.13, and then re-upload them.

```

#### Workaround

If you encounter any of the errors mentioned above, you can attempt to rebuild and reload the NGINX Management Suite policy. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `nms.te` and `nms.fc` files to a directory on your target machine.

    - {{< fa "download" >}} {{< link "/nim/release-notes/41327/nms.te" "nms.te" >}}
    - {{< fa "download" >}} {{< link "/nim/release-notes/41327/nms.fc" "nms.fc" >}}

2. [Install the `policycoreutils-devel` package](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/using_selinux/index#selinux-architecture_getting-started-with-selinux).
3. Change to the directory where you copied the `nms.te` and `nms.fc` files.
4. Rebuild the `nms.pp` file:

    ```bash
    make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel//Makefile nms.pp
    ```

5. Remove any existing NGINX Management Suite policy:

    ```bash
    sudo semodule -r nms
    ```

6. Install the new policy:

    ```bash
    sudo semodule -n -i nms.pp
    ```

7. To finish installing the NGINX Management Suite policy, follow the remaining instructions from the package manager output and restart the NGINX Management Suite services:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nms
    ```

8. After 10 minutes, check there are no more SELinux errors:

    ```bash
    sudo ausearch -m avc --raw -se nms -ts recent
    ```

       curl -k https://<NMS_FQDN>/packages-repository/nginx-signing.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/nginx-signing.gpg >/dev/null
       ```

2. Update the `nginx-agent.list` file to reference the new key:

    ```shell
    printf "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nginx-signing.gpg] https://<NMS_FQDN>/packages-repository/deb/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` agent\n" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx-agent.list

#### Workaround

Download the `attack-signatures` and/or `threat-campaigns` packages for CentOS 7, RHEL 7, or Amazon Linux 2 from the NGINX repo directly to your Instance Manager host by following the instructions in the official NGINX App Protect documentation:

- [Attack Signatures Documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-app-protect/admin-guide/install/#centos--rhel-74--amazon-linux-2)
- [Threat Campaigns Documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-app-protect/admin-guide/install/#centos--rhel-74--amazon-linux-2-1)

After downloading the `attack-signatures` and/or `threat-campaigns` packages onto your Instance Manager host, give Instance Manager about 15 seconds to recognize these packages.

## 2.3.0
June 30, 2022

### {{% icon-bug %}} Scan misidentifies some NGINX OSS instances as NGINX Plus {#35172}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 35172 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When NGINX Plus is installed on a datapath instance, then removed and replaced with NGINX OSS, NGINX Instance Manager may incorrectly identify the instance as an NGINX Plus instance. This is due to multiple NGINX entries for the same datapath.

#### Workaround

Use NGINX Instance Manager's NGINX Instances API to remove the inactive NGINX instance. For instructions, refer to the API reference guide, which you can find at `https://<NGINX-INSTANCE-MANAGER-FQDN>/ui/docs`.

You may need to stop the NGINX Agent first. To stop the NGINX Agent, take the following steps:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx-agent
```

### {{% icon-bug %}} Metrics may report additional data {#34255}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 34255 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
NGINX Instance Manager reports metrics at a per-minute interval and includes dimensions for describing the metric data's characteristics.

An issue has been identified in which metric data is aggregated across all dimensions, not just for existing metrics data. When querying the Metrics API with aggregations like `SUM(metric-name)`, the aggregated data causes the API to over count the metric. This overcounting skews some of the metrics dashboards.

#### Workaround

When querying the Metrics API, you can exclude the data for an aggregated dimension by specifying the dimension name in the `filterBy` query parameter.

```none
filterBy=<dimension-name>!= ''
```

### {{% icon-bug %}} Giving long names (255+ characters) to certificates causes internal error {#34185}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 34185 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When adding certificates, an internal error (error code: 134018) is returned if the name given for the certificate exceeds 255 characters.

#### Workaround

Use a name that is 255 or fewer characters.

## 2.1.0
April 05, 2022

### {{% icon-bug %}} An unexpected number of instances are shown after upgrading nginx-agent to 2.1.0 {#33307}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 33307 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
After upgrading to NGINX Instance Manager 2.1.0, and updating nginx-agent from platform packaging, duplicate instances may appear on the Instance overview page. This issue is caused by a change in how the NGINX Agent generates the `system_uid`.

#### Workaround

You can safely delete the older entries or wait for them to expire.

---

### {{% icon-bug %}} “No such process” error occurs when publishing a configuration {#33160}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 33160 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When publishing a configuration, you might encounter an error similar to the following example:

``` text
config action failed: Config apply failed (write): no such process
```

This error can occur when there is a desyncronization between the NGINX Agent and NGINX PID, often after manually restarting NGINX when the Agent is running.

#### Workaround

Restart the NGINX Agent:

``` bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx-agent
```

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Instance Manager reports old NGINX version after upgrade {#31225}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 31225 | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.7.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
  After upgrading NGINX to a new version, the NGINX Instance Manager web interface and API report the old NGINX version until the NGINX Agent is restarted.

#### Workaround

  Restart the Agent to have the new version reflected properly:

  ```bash
  systemctl restart nginx-agent
  ```

---

### {{% icon-bug %}} Web interface doesn’t report error when failing to upload large config files {#31081}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 31081 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
In the web interface, when uploading a config file that's larger than 50 MB (max size), the system incorrectly reports the state as `Analyzing` (Status code `403`), although the upload failed.

#### Workaround

Keep config files under 50 MB.

### {{% icon-bug %}} CentOS 7, RHEL 7, and Amazon Linux 2 package managers allow unsupported NGINX/NGINX Plus versions {#28758}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 28758 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When installing on CentOS 7, RHEL 7, and Amazon Linux 2, the package manager doesn't prevent installing NGINX Instance Manager with unsupported versions of NGINX or NGINX Plus. As a consequence, it is possible that `nms-instance-manager` is installed without an NGINX gateway. Resulting in a less than optimal experience.

#### Workaround

Install a supported version of NGINX (v1.18 or later) or NGINX Plus (R22 or later). See the [Technical Specifications]({{< relref "nms/tech-specs.md" >}}) guide for details.

  ```

#### Workaround

Make sure your version of NGINX is v1.18 or later.
