## Overview

You can use API Connectivity Manager to create and manage Developer Portals (or, "Dev Portals") to host your APIs and documentation. API Connectivity Manager Dev Portals provide a framework for customization that lets you match your Dev Portal to your brand's or business' requirements.
You can customize the Dev Portal website's landing page, All APIs page, and Docs page(s), as well as the site's header and footer.

### Before You Begin

Complete the following prerequisites before proceeding with this guide:

- API Connectivity Manager is installed, licensed, and running.
- You have one or more Environments with a [Developer Portal]({{< ref "/nms/acm/getting-started/add-devportal" >}}) cluster.
- You have verified that you can access the Developer Portal using the configured hostname.

### How to Access the User Interface

## Customize a Developer Portal {#create-dev-portal}

API Connectivity Manager uses a Dev Portal framework to define the look and feel of Developer Portals. These settings are applied at the Cluster level and apply to all Developer Portals hosted by the Cluster.

Take the steps below to customize your Dev Portal by defining a custom Dev Portal framework.

1. In the API Connectivity Manager user interface, go to **Environments > \<your environment\>**, where "your environment" is the Environment that contains a Developer Portal.
1. Select **Edit Portal Theme** from the **Actions** menu for the desired Developer Portal. You can then edit any of the options provided.

    - [Brand](#brand-options)
    - [Style](#style-options)
    - [Website](#website-options)

1. You can save your changes at any time by selecting the **Save and Publish** option.
