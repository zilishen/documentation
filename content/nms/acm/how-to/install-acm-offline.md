### Set Up the Data Plane {#acm-offline-dependencies}

The API Connectivity Manager data plane requires [NGINX Plus R24](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/) or later and [njs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/)..

1. Log in to MyF5 and download your `nginx-repo.crt` and `nginx-repo.key` files.
2. Copy the `nginx-repo.crt` and `nginx-repo.key` files to the `/etc/ssl/nginx/` directory:

    ```bash
    sudo cp nginx-repo.crt /etc/ssl/nginx/
    sudo cp nginx-repo.key /etc/ssl/nginx/
    ```

3. Select the following link to download the `fetch-external-acm-dataplane-dependencies.sh` script. This script downloads the necessary NGINX Plus and njs packages to a `tar.gz` archive.

    {{<fa "download">}} {{<link "/scripts/fetch-external-acm-dataplane-dependencies.sh" "Download fetch-external-acm-dataplane-dependencies.sh script">}}

4. To download the NGINX Plus and njs dependencies, run the `fetch-external-acm-dataplane-dependencies.sh` script. As parameters, specify your Linux distribution and the location of your `nginx-repo.crt` and `nginx-repo.key` files.

    ```bash
    sudo bash fetch-external-acm-dataplane-dependencies.sh <linux distribution> /etc/ssl/nginx/nginx-repo.crt /etc/ssl/nginx/nginx-repo.key
    ```

    Supported Linux distributions:

    - `ubuntu18.04`
    - `ubuntu20.04`
    - `debian10`
    - `debian11`
    - `centos7`
    - `centos8`
    - `rhel7`
    - `rhel8`
    - `amzn2`

    For example, to download external dependencies for Ubuntu 20.04:

    ```bash
    sudo bash fetch-external-acm-dataplane-dependencies.sh ubuntu20.04 /etc/ssl/nginx/nginx-repo.crt /etc/ssl/nginx/nginx-repo.key
    ```

    In this example, the script creates an archive called `acm-dataplane-dependencies-ubuntu20.04.tar.gz` with the external dependencies.

5. After you copy and extract the bundle onto your target machine, take the following steps to install the packages:

    {{< note >}}The bundled NGINX Plus package may conflict with installed versions of NGINX Plus. Delete the package from the bundle if you want to keep the existing version.{{< /note >}}

    {{<tabs name="install-acm-dataplane-dependencies">}}
    {{%tab name="CentOS, RHEL, and RPM-Based"%}}

```bash

```
