## Overview

{{< include "acm/how-to/policies-proxy-intro.md" >}}

## About the Policy

API Connectivity Manager can configure your API Proxies to continually test your backend service targets (upstream servers), avoid the servers that have failed, and gracefully add the recovered services to a load-balanced group. This continuous testing is also known as "Active Health Checks," whereas "Passive Health Checks" monitor transactions as they occur.

More information on NGINX health checks can be found at:

- <https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-health-check>
- <https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/grpc-health-check/>

## HTTP Health Checks

### Before You Begin

To complete the steps in this guide, you need the following:

- API Connectivity Manager is installed, licensed, and running
- You have [one or more Environments with an API Gateway]({{< ref "/nms/acm/getting-started/add-api-gateway.md" >}})
- You have [published one or more API Gateways]({{< ref "/nms/acm/getting-started/publish-api-proxy.md" >}})
- Your backend service(s) has an HTTP health check endpoint and/or can return status codes in the range from 200 through 399 for health check requests.

### Policy Settings

To create a Health Check policy using the web interface:

1. {{< include "acm/webui-acm-login.md" >}}
1. On the left menu, select **Services**.
1. Select a workspace in the list that contains the API Proxy you want to update.
1. On the workspace overview page, on the **API Proxies** tab, locate the API Proxy you want to update. Select the **Actions** menu (represented by an ellipsis, `...`), then select **Edit Proxy**.
1. On the left-side *API Proxy* menu, select **Policies**.
1. On the *Advanced > Policies* page, on the **API Proxy** tab, locate the **Backend Health Check** policy. Select the **Actions** menu (represented by an ellipsis, `...`), then select **Add Policy**.
1. Complete the necessary fields:

   - **Apply the policy to**: Specify the label that was assigned to the backend service if it's different from the default value `default`.
   - **Transport Protocol**: Specify the transport protocol of the health check.  Currently, only HTTP is supported.
   - **Is Mandatory**: Toggle the switch to on if every new service target (server) must pass all configured health checks before NGINX Plus sends traffic to it.
   - **Port**: If the health check needs to be conducted on a port other than the one specified for the backend service targets, specify the port to use.
   - **Interval**: The length of time between each health check sent from NGINX Plus to the backend service targets.
   - **Unhealthy Threshold**: Denotes the number of failed checks before the service is considered unhealthy.
   - **Health Threshold**: Denotes the number of successful checks before the service is considered healthy.
   - **URI Path**: The endpoint (URI) that NGINX Plus uses for the health check requests.
   - **Status Code Exact**: The list of specific HTTP status codes to match against in the backend response.
   - **Status Code Range**: The list of HTTP status code ranges to match against in the backend response.
   - **Header Name**: The name of the header to use in the backend response matching.
   - **Header Condition**: The operator used when checking the header value.  Refer to the [NGINX `match` directive documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_hc_module.html?&_ga=2.33487351.893608448.1680639753-1533979881.1676506809#match) for specifics.
   - **Header Value**: The header value to use in the backend response matching.
   - **Body Required Variable**: The field in the JSON of the backend response body to match against.
   - **Body Condition**: The operator used when checking the body value.  Refer to the [NGINX `match` directive documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_hc_module.html?&_ga=2.33487351.893608448.1680639753-1533979881.1676506809#match) for specifics.
   - **Body Value**: The body value to use in the backend response matching.
   - **Connection Timeout**: Sets a timeout for establishing a connection with a proxied server. Follows NGINX configuration file measurement units syntax.
   - **Read Timeout**: Sets a timeout for reading a response from the proxied server. Follows NGINX configuration file measurement units syntax.

1. Select **Add** to apply the Health Check policy to the API Proxy.  Then select **Save & Publish** to deploy the configuration to the API Proxy.

{{%/tab%}}

{{</tabs>}}

### Verify the Policy

Confirm that the policy has been set up and configured correctly by taking these steps:

- Check that your backend service targets (upstream servers) are receiving health check endpoint calls.
- When `isMandatory` is set to `true`, verify that your backend service targets are not receiving proxied traffic until they clear the health checks.
- When `persistent` is set to `true`, the state and behavior for `interval`, `unhealthyThreshold`, `healthyThreshold`, and timeout-related parameters should be preserved between subsequent deployments of API proxies and environments.

## gRPC Health Checks

### Before You Begin

To complete the steps in this guide, you need the following:

- API Connectivity Manager is installed, licensed, and running
- You have [one or more Environments with a gRPC API Gateway]({{< ref "/nms/acm/getting-started/add-api-gateway.md" >}})
- You have [published one or more gRPC API Gateways]({{< ref "/nms/acm/how-to/services/publish-grpc-proxy.md" >}})
- Your backend service(s) implements the [gRPC health checking protocol](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md#grpc-health-checking-protocol) and/or returns a status code (normally `12` for `unimplemented`) for health check requests.

### Verify the Policy

Confirm that the policy has been set up and configured correctly by taking these steps:

- Check that your backend service targets (upstream servers) are receiving health check endpoint calls. You may also find the tools [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) and [grpc-health-probe](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe) helpful for debugging.
- When `mandatory` is set to `true`, verify that your backend service targets are not receiving proxied traffic until they clear the health checks.
- When `persistent` is set to `true`, state and behavior for `interval`, `passes`, `fails`, and timeout related parameters should be preserved between subsequent deployments of API Proxies and Environments.
