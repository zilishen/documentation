## Objectives

By completing the guides in this Quick Start series, you can easily get up and running with API Connectivity Manager.

This series covers the following topics:

1. Setting up an environment with [API Gateway]({{< relref "./add-api-gateway" >}}) & [Developer Portal]({{< ref "add-devportal" >}}) clusters.
2. Onboarding F5 NGINX Plus instances onto the clusters.
3. [Publishing an API proxy]({{< ref "publish-api-proxy" >}}) with or without an OpenAPI spec.

---

## Requirements

To complete the instructions in this series, you must meet the following requirements:

1. [Install API Connectivity Manager and Developer Portal]({{< ref "/nim/deploy/_index.md" >}}) on [separate hosts]({{< ref "/nim/fundamentals/tech-specs.md" >}}).
2. [Install a supported version of NGINX Plus]({{< ref "/nim/fundamentals/tech-specs.md" >}}) on one or more hosts to serve as the API Gateway.
3. [Install the `njs` module](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/dynamic-modules/nginscript/) on your NGINX data plane and Dev Portal hosts.
4. You have SSH access and `sudo` permissions for the NGINX data plane host(s).
5. You have an API Connectivity Manager user account with permission to READ, CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE on the following API Connectivity Manager features:

    - Infrastructure
    - Services

## How to Access the REST API

{{< include "acm/how-to/access-acm-api" >}}

For example:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{nms-fqdn}}/api/acm/v1/services/workspaces/{{workspaceName}}' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <access token>' \
--data-raw ''
```

## Variables

The examples provided in these guides use a set of common variables.
You should replace these variables -- or define a set of values for them in your API client -- with information relevant to your environment before trying to use them.
The variables used in the examples are described in the table below.
