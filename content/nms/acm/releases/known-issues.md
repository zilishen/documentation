## 1.5.0
March 28, 2023

### {{% icon-bug %}} Using policies with targetPolicyName set to anything other than the default value can cause unexpected results. {#42682}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 42682 | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
Creating a policy with metadata of “targetPolicyName” set to anything but default can cause issues with secrets being duplicated if more than one policy is created. Setting this value to anything but the default value will also cause the policy to not be applied. The policy may be shown as applied in the UI when it is not.

#### Workaround

Do not modify the “targetPolicyName” to be anything but the default value.

---

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Array values in token claims are treated as string values {#42388}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 42388 | Fixed in API Connectivity Manager 1.6.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When an Access Control Routing match rule targeted a token value that contained an array, the array was collapsed into a comma-separated string. However, the expected behavior is for rules targeting arrays to pass if any value within the array matches the condition, rather than requiring the entire array to match.

---

### {{% icon-resolved %}} The web interface doesn't pass the `enableSNI` property for the TLS backend policy {#39445}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 39445 | Fixed in API Connectivity Manager 1.3.1   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When configuring a TLS backend policy in the web interface, the new `enableSNI` property does not match the value of the deprecated `proxyServerName` property, resulting in an API error. The `enableSNI` value must be the same as `proxyServerName` value.

#### Workaround

Use the NGINX Management Suite API Connectivity Manager REST API to send a PUT request to the following endpoint, providing the correct values for `enableSNI` and `proxyServerName`. Both values must match.

{{< raw-html>}}<div class="table-responsive">{{</raw-html>}}
{{<bootstrap-table "table">}}
| Method | Endpoint                                                                             |

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 39328 | Fixed in API Connectivity Manager 1.4.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When using JWT authentication with advanced routes, a JWT token that is provided as a query parameter will not be proxied to the backend service.

#### Workaround

Pass the JWT token as a header instead of providing the JWT token as a query parameter.

## 1.2.0
October 18, 2022

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Developer Portal backend information is unintentionally updated when editing clusters within an environment {#39409}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 39409 | Fixed in API Connectivity Manager 1.3.1   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
The Developer Portal backend information may be inadvertently updated in the following circumstances:

1. If you have multiple Developer Portal clusters and update the backend information (for example, enable TLS or change the host or port, etc. ) for any of those clusters, the update is applied to all of the clusters.

2. If you have one or more Developer Portal clusters and update any other cluster in the environment (for example, the API Gateway or Developer Portal Internal cluster), the backend settings for the Developer Clusters are reset to their defaults (127.0.0.1/8080/no TSL).

#### Workaround

- Workaround for scenario #1

  Use the NGINX Management Suite API Connectivity Manager REST API to send a PUT request to the following endpoint with the correct backend settings for each Developer Portal cluster:

  {{< raw-html>}}<div class="table-responsive">{{</raw-html>}}
  {{<bootstrap-table "table">}}
  | Method | Endpoint                                                                             |
  |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | PUT    | `/infrastructure/workspaces/{{infraWorkspaceName}}/environments/{{environmentName}}` |
  {{</bootstrap-table>}}
  {{< raw-html>}}</div>{{</raw-html>}}

- Workaround for scenario #2

  If you have just one Developer Portal cluster, you can use the web interface to update the backend settings for the cluster if you're not using the default settings.

  If you have more than one Developer Portal cluster, use the NGINX Management Suite API Connectivity Manager REST API to send a PUT request to the following endpoint with the correct backend settings for each cluster:

  {{< raw-html>}}<div class="table-responsive">{{</raw-html>}}
  {{<bootstrap-table "table">}}
  | Method | Endpoint                                                                             |
  |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | PUT    | `/infrastructure/workspaces/{{infraWorkspaceName}}/environments/{{environmentName}}` |
  {{</bootstrap-table>}}
  {{< raw-html>}}</div>{{</raw-html>}}

### {{% icon-resolved %}} The user interface is erroneously including irrelevant information on the TLS inbound policy workflow {#38046}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 38046 | Fixed in API Connectivity Manager 1.3.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
On the TLS inbound policy, toggling `Enable Client Verification` On/Off results in the user interface adding irrelevant information that causes the publish to fail due to validation error.

#### Workaround

Dismiss the policy without saving and restart the UI workflow to add the TLS inbound policy.

---

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Portals secured with TLS policy require additional environment configuration prior to publishing API docs {#38028}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 38028 | Fixed in API Connectivity Manager 1.3.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When the `tls-backend` policy is applied on a developer portal cluster, the communication between the portal UI and portal backend service is secured. By default, when the portal cluster is created, and the backend is not explicitly specified in the payload, it defaults to HTTP.   Adding the tls-backend policy does not automatically upgrade the protocol to HTTPS. If the protocol is not set to HTTPS, publishing API docs to the portal will fail. The user has to explicitly change the backend protocol to HTTPS.

#### Workaround

In the user interface, navigate to Workspace > Environment > Developer Portal Clusters > Edit Advanced Config. Select "edit the Backend" and toggle the Enable TLS switch to enabled.

---

### {{% icon-resolved %}}  A proxy deployed with a `specRef` field (OAS) and `basePathVersionAppendRule` set to other than `NONE` may cause versions to appear twice in the deployed location block {#36666}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 36666 | Fixed in API Connectivity Manager 1.9.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
If you add an API doc and reference it with the `specRef` field in the proxy object, the OAS (API doc) is used as the source of truth for the base path. If the OAS (API doc) contains the full correct base path, and you use any `basePathVersionAppendRule` value other than `NONE`, the base path will be corrupted by appending/prepending the version in the deployment (e.g. `/api/v3/v3`).

#### Workaround

If you are using an API doc with a proxy:

  1. Put the entire true base path of the API in the server section of the API doc:

      ```nginx
      Servers:
      - url: https://(API-address)/api/v3
      ```

      or

      ```nginx
      Servers:
      - url: /api/v3
      ```

      {{< note >}}In the example above only  `/api/v3` is relevant for this issue, and it should be the full base path to which the individual paths in the API document can be appended directly. {{< /note >}}

  2. Set the value of the base path version append rule (`basePathVersionAppendRule`) in the proxy to `NONE`.

### {{% icon-resolved %}} New users are unable to see pages even though they have been given access. {#36607}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 36607 | Fixed in API Connectivity Manager 1.3.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
A newly created role needs a minimum of READ access on the LICENSING feature. Without this, the users will not have access to the pages even though they have been granted permission. They will see 403 errors surfacing as license errors while accessing the pages.

#### Workaround

Assign a minimum of READ access on the LICENSING feature to all new roles

## 1.0.0
July 19, 2022

### {{% icon-resolved %}} The API Connectivity Manager module won't load if the Security Monitoring module is enabled {#39943}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 39943 | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.8.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
If you have Instance Manager 2.7 or earlier installed and attempt to enable both the API Connectivity Manager and Security Monitoring modules on the same NGINX Management Suite management plane, the API Connectivity Manager module will not load because of incompatibility issues with the Security Monitoring module.

#### Workaround

Before enabling the API Connectivity Manager and Security Monitoring modules, ensure that your Instance Manager is upgraded to version 2.8 or later. Be sure to read the release notes for each module carefully, as they may contain important information about version dependencies.

To see which version of Instance Manager you have installed, run the following command:

- CentOS, RHEL, RPM-based:

   ```bash
   yum info nms-instance-manager
   ```

- Debian, Ubuntu, Deb-based:

   ```bash
   dpkg -s nms-instance-manager

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Credentials endpoint is disabled by default {#35630}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 35630 | Fixed in API Connectivity Manager 1.2.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
For security reasons, the credentials endpoint on API Connectivity Manager(ACM) is disabled by default. To use the developer portal credentials workflow, configuration changes need to be made on the ACM host to enable credentials endpoints. Also, communication between ACM and the developer portal can be secured by providing certificates.

#### Workaround

To enable the credentials endpoints on ACM host

1. SSH to the ACM host
1. Enable resource credentials endpoint
  In {{/etc/nms/nginx/locations/nms-acm.conf}}, uncomment the location block

    ```nginx
    #Deployment of resource credentials from the devportal
    #  Uncomment this block when using devportal. Authentication is disabled
    #  for this location. This location block will mutually
    #  verify the client trying to access the credentials API.
    #  location = /api/v1/devportal/credentials {
    #    OIDC authentication (uncomment to disable)
    #    auth_jwt off;
    #    auth_basic off;
    #    error_page 401 /401_certs.json;
    #    if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
    #      return 401;
    #    }
    #    proxy_pass http://apim-service/api/v1/devportal/credentials;
    #}
    ```

1. Save the changes.
1. Reload NGINX on the ACM host: `nginx -s reload`
