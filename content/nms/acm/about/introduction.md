[API Connectivity Manager]({{< ref "/nms/acm/">}}) enables self-service and automation of API delivery. API Connectivity Manager allows you to deploy, configure, secure, monitor, and govern API gateways at scale.

The API Connectivity Manager module provides a [REST API]({{< ref "/nms/acm/about/api-overview">}}) that uses standard authentication methods, HTTP response codes, and verbs.

You can use the API Connectivity Manager API to connect, secure, and govern your APIs. In addition, API Connectivity Manager lets you separate infrastructure lifecycle management from the API lifecycle, allowing your IT/Ops teams and application developers to work independently.

The API Connectivity Manager module provides the following features:

- [Create and manage isolated workspaces]({{< ref "/nms/acm/how-to/infrastructure/manage-api-infrastructure.md#create-a-workspace">}})
