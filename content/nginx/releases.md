### Software Development Policy

Each F5 NGINX Plus release reaches End of Software Development (EoSD) on the release date of the next version. For NGINX Plus, EoSD means no additional features or routine bug fixes will be applied to that version.
Critical bug patches and security updates are applied to the two (2) most recent releases of NGINX Plus.

We strongly recommend running the latest version of NGINX Plus in production to ensure you have the latest features, security updates, and critical patches.

### Technical Support Services

F5 offers 24 months of technical support for each F5 NGINX Plus release. The 24-month support period begins on the initial release date for each version of NGINX Plus, as noted in the table. The release of a patch (for example, `NGINX Plus R33p2`) does not reset the 24-month technical support period for the impacted release.

## NGINX Plus Release 34 (R34)
_01 April 2025_<br/>
_Based on NGINX Open Source 1.27.4_

NGINX Plus R34 is a feature release:

- [OIDC authentication support]({{< ref "nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-oidc.md" >}}) via native [ngx_http_oidc_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_oidc_module.html) module.

- NGINX usage reporting: [proxy](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html#proxy) support.
- [Caching](https://blog.nginx.org/blog/optimizing-resource-usage-for-complex-ssl-configurations) of SSL certificates and secret keys with variables for [http](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_certificate_cache) and [stream](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_ssl_module.html#ssl_certificate_cache).

- The [`keepalive_min_timeout`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#keepalive_min_timeout) directive.

- TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 are the default [SSL protocols](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_protocols) (if supported by the OpenSSL library). If OpenSSL 1.0.0 or older is used, the default SSL protocols are TLSv1 and TLSv1.1.

- Bugfixes in QUIC and HTTP/3, mail proxy, the MP4 module, the `proxy_store` and `proxy_bind` directives.

- Security: insufficient check in virtual servers handling with TLSv1.3 SNI allowed to reuse SSL sessions in a different virtual server, to bypass client SSL certificates verification ([CVE-2025-23419](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-23419)).


NGINX Plus R34 is supported on:

## NGINX Plus Release 33 (R33)
_19 November 2024_<br/>
_Based on NGINX Open Source 1.27.2_

NGINX Plus R33 is a feature release:

- Licensing: Each NGINX Plus instance now requires a JWT license file. The JWT must be obtained from [MyF5](https://account.f5.com/myf5) and is expected to be located at `/etc/nginx/` for Linux or
`/usr/local/etc/nginx/` for FreeBSD or at the path specified by the [`license_token`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html#license_token) in the [`mgmt`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html) context.

- NGINX usage reporting: Usage report is sent to F5 licensing endpoint [every hour](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html#usage_report) using the [secure](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html#ssl_verify) connection. The initial usage report should be sent once NGINX Plus starts after installation or upgrade to R33. If the initial usage report is not received by the endpoint, NGINX Plus will stop processing traffic. A 180-day grace period can be [enabled](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html#enforce_initial_report) to submit the initial usage report.

  Optionally, for network-restricted environments, reporting can be [configured](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html#usage_report) to [NGINX Instance Manager]({{< ref "nim/index.md" >}}) from which the report can be sent to F5 licensing endpoint.

  For more information about licensing and usage reporting, see [About subscription licenses]({{< ref "solutions/about-subscription-licenses.md" >}}) article and [`ngx_mgmt_module`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html) module documentation.

- OCSP stapling support and client certificate validation with OCSP
in the [stream](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_ssl_module.html) module with the
[`ssl_ocsp`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_ssl_module.html#ssl_ocsp) and [`ssl_ocsp_responder`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_ssl_module.html#ssl_ocsp_responder) directives.

- SSL key logging with the
`ssl_key_log` directive for [http](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_key_log), [stream](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_ssl_module.html#ssl_key_log),
[proxy](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_ssl_key_log), [grpc](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_grpc_module.html#grpc_ssl_key_log), [uwsgi](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_uwsgi_module.html#uwsgi_ssl_key_log) that allows logging SSL keys created during client and upstream connections to the file.
The argument is a file name in the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` format compatible with Wireshark.

- SSL Certificate Caching: Fixed loading of trusted CA bundles containing entries with duplicate Distinguished Name (DN).

- Change: the [`ssl_client_certificate`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_client_certificate) directive is not required for client SSL certificates verification.

- Response trailers support in proxy with the [`proxy_pass_trailers`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass_trailers) directive that allows passing trailer fields from a proxied server to a client.

- The [NGINX JavaScript]({{< ref "nginx/admin-guide/dynamic-modules/nginscript.md" >}}) module was updated to version [0.8.7](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/changes.html#njs0.8.7), featuring QuickJS [runtime support](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/engine.html).

- Added initial support for Post Quantum Cryptography.

<span id="r32"></span>
## NGINX Plus Release 32 (R32)
_29 May 2024_<br/>
_Based on NGINX Open Source 1.25.5_

NGINX Plus R32 is a feature release:

- SSL certificate caching that improves the NGINX startup time and memory usage in cases of configurations with large number of locations with relatively small number of unique certificate/key pairs

- The [`stream_pass`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_pass_module.html) module that allows passing the accepted connection directly to any configured listening socket in `http`, `stream`, `mail`, and other similar modules

- NGINX Plus [official container images](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-docker/)

- [Virtual servers](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html#server_name) in the [`stream`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html) module

- The `deferred`, `accept_filter`, and `setfib` parameters of the [listen](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html#listen) directive in the [`stream`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html) module

- Cache line size detection for some architectures

- Security fixes:

  - Heap Overflow w/ write ([CVE-2024-32760](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000139609)): Undisclosed HTTP/3 encoder instructions can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or cause other possible impacts

  - Stack Overflow / Use after free ([CVE-2024-31079](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000139611)): Undisclosed HTTP/3 requests can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or cause other possible impacts. This attack requires that a request be specifically timed during the connection draining process, which the attacker has no visibility and limited influence over

  - Null Pointer Dereference w/ Empty Header ([CVE-2024-35200](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000139612)): Undisclosed HTTP/3 requests can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or cause other possible impacts

  - Memory Disclosure during QUIC handshake ([CVE-2024-34161](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000139627)): When the network infrastructure supports a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of 4096 or greater without fragmentation, undisclosed QUIC messages can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or cause leakage of previously freed memory

- Bugfixes:

  - in the [MQTT Filter](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_mqtt_filter_module.html) module: malformed packets when using default properties

  - in the [zone_sync](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_zone_sync_module.html) module: memory leak on configuration reload

  - Unexpected connection closure while using 0-RTT in QUIC

  - Connections with pending AIO operations might be closed prematurely during graceful shutdown of old worker processes

  - Socket leak alerts no longer logged when fast shutdown was requested after graceful shutdown of old worker processes

  - A socket descriptor error, a socket leak, or a segmentation fault in a worker process (for SSL proxying) might occur if AIO was used in a subrequest

  - A segmentation fault might occur in a worker process if SSL proxying was used along with the [image_filter](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_image_filter_module.html) directive and errors with code 415 were redirected with the [error_page](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#error_page) directive

  - Bugfixes and improvements in HTTP/3

- New features and bugfixes in njs:

  - setting the `Server `header for outgoing header

  - QuickJS engine support in CLI

NGINX Plus R32 is supported on:

<span id="r31_p2"></span>
NGINX Plus R31 P2<br/>
_29 May 2024_

- Security:

  - Heap Overflow w/ write ([CVE-2024-32760](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000139609)): Undisclosed HTTP/3 encoder instructions can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or cause other possible impacts

  - Stack Overflow / Use after free ([CVE-2024-31079](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000139611)): Undisclosed HTTP/3 requests can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or cause other possible impacts. This attack requires that a request be specifically timed during the connection draining process, which the attacker has no visibility and limited influence over

  - Null Pointer Dereference w/ Empty Header ([CVE-2024-35200](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000139612)): Undisclosed HTTP/3 requests can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or cause other possible impacts

  - Memory Disclosure during QUIC handshake ([CVE-2024-34161](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000139627)): When the network infrastructure supports a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of 4096 or greater without fragmentation, undisclosed QUIC messages can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or cause leakage of previously freed memory

<span id="r31_p3"></span>
NGINX Plus R31 P3<br/>
_14 August 2024_

- Security:

  - In the [MQTT Filter](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_mqtt_filter_module.html) module, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization ([CVE-2024-39792](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000140108))

  - In the [MP4](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_mp4_module.html) module, a specially crafted `mp4` file can cause NGINX worker memory over-read resulting in its termination by using a specially crafted `mp4` file ([CVE-2024-7347](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000140529))

- Optional NGINX diagnostic scripts that collect the data
required for troubleshooting are available as a separate download package

- New features in [njs](http://nginx.org/en/docs/njs):

  - global NGINX properties: [`ngx.build`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_build), [`ngx.conf_file_path`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_conf_file_path), [`ngx.error_log_path`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_error_log_path), [`ngx.prefix`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_prefix), [`ngx.version`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_version), [`ngx.version_number`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_version_number), [`ngx.worker_id`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#ngx_worker_id)

  - the `js_shared_dict_zone` directive for [http](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_js_module.html#js_shared_dict_zone) and [stream](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_js_module.html#js_shared_dict_zone) that allows declaring a dictionary shared between worker processes

  - [ES13-compliant](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/compatibility.html) `Array` methods: `from()`, `toSorted()`, `toSpliced()`, `toReversed()`

  - [`CryptoKey`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#cryptokey) properties in `WebCrypto` API: [`algorithm`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#cryptokey_alg), [`extractable`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#cryptokey_extractable), [`type`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#cryptokey_type), [`usages`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/reference.html#cryptokey_usages)

- The GeoIP2 module is no longer available for Amazon Linux 2 as the EPEL repository doesn't provide the `libmaxminddb` library required to build the module

### NGINX Plus R30 Update

This is an improvement release for NGINX Plus R30.

NGINX Plus R30 P1<br/>
_11 October 2023_

- Additional protection against HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack vulnerability ([CVE-2023-44487](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-44487)) that may affect NGINX only when it is configured with the [keepalive requests](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#keepalive_requests) value substantially higher than the default value. Limitations in HTTP/2 protocol allow clients to produce a higher RPS rate than expected from a configured HTTP/2 [max concurrent streams](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_concurrent_streams) setting which can be exploited to trigger a Denial-of-Service attack.

## NGINX Plus Release 27 (R27)
_28 June 2022_<br/>
_Based on NGINX Open Source 1.21.6_

NGINX Plus R27 is a feature release:

- API version 8:

  - SSL statistics for each HTTP [upstream](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#def_nginx_http_upstream) and stream [upstream](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#def_nginx_stream_upstream)

  - SSL statistics for each HTTP [server zone](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#def_nginx_http_server_zone) and stream [server zone](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#def_nginx_stream_server_zone)

- JWT Authentication: error code can be customized with the `error` parameter of the [`auth_jwt_require`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_jwt_module.html#auth_jwt_require) directive if any additional condition of JWT validation fails

- HTTP health checks: the [`keepalive_time`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_hc_module.html#health_check_keepalive_time) parameter of the [`health_check`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_hc_module.html#health_check) directive
that enables keepalive connections for health checks and specifies the time
during which requests can be processed through one keepalive connection

- The [Prometheus-njs module](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/dynamic-modules/prometheus-njs/) now supports version [`7`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#compatibility) of the [API](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html), including `/stream/limit_conns/`, `/http/limit_conns/`, `/http/limit_req/` data, and HTTP status code statistics for [upstreams](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#def_nginx_http_upstream), [server zones](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#def_nginx_http_server_zone) and [location zones](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#def_nginx_http_location_zone)

## NGINX Plus Release 12 (R12)
_14 March 2017_<br/>
_Based on NGINX Open Source 1.11.10_

NGINX Plus R12 is a feature release:

- Synchronization of NGINX Plus configuration across instances in a cluster, from a single primary node (new `nginx_sync` package)
- Updates to Extended Status module [data set](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html#data), including NGINX Plus version (`nginx_build`), usage statistics for shared memory zones (under the `slabs/` subtree), and additional upstream fields (`name`, `service`)
- New statistics displayed on [live activity monitoring dashboard](http://demo.nginx.com/): NGINX Plus version, response time metrics, shared memory zones usage, and server names for upstreams
- [Support](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_use_stale) for the `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error` extensions to the `Cache-Control` header, as defined by [RFC 5861](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5861.txt)
- Ability to bypass cache for byte range requests after a specified offset (the [proxy_cache_max_range_offset](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_max_range_offset) directive)
- Length of `Vary` and `ETag` cache headers increased to 128 bytes; note that the on‑disk cache format has changed, so cached content is invalidated after the upgrade and must be refreshed from the origin server
- `mandatory` parameter to the `health_check` directive ([HTTP](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_hc_module.html#health_check) and [Stream](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_hc_module.html#health_check)) which requires servers newly added to an `upstream` group to pass the associated health check before receiving real traffic
- “Zero config” UDP [health check](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_hc_module.html#health_check) which does not require specifying a [match](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_hc_module.html#match) block
- Support in the Stream module for verification of [client SSL certificates](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_ssl_module.html#ssl_verify_client) for TCP applications
- [SSL variables](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#variables) representing various details about client certificates and capabilities (`$ssl_ciphers`, `$ssl_client_v_end`, `$ssl_client_v_start`, `$ssl_client_v_remain`, and `$ssl_curves`)
- The `$ssl_client_verify` variable includes the reason for failure
- The `$ssl_client_i_dn` and `ssl_client_s_dn` variables comply with [RFC 2253](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2253.txt); legacy variants are available as `$ssl_client_i_dn_legacy` and `$ssl_client_s_dn_legacy`
- Support for accessing arbitrary JWT fields as [variables](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_jwt_module.html)
- Support for JSON escaping in access logs (the `escape` parameter to the [log_format](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html#log_format) directive)
- WebP support in the [Image-Filter](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_image_filter_module.html) module.
- Output from the `nginx` `-T` command excludes duplicated sections of configuration
- Improvements to memory usage and performance, including upstream [queue](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#queue) optimization

NGINX Plus R12 is supported on:

_25 May 2016_

- Segmentation fault might occur when writing a client request body to a temporary file
- Specially crafted request might cause NGINX worker process to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference ([CVE-2016-4450](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4450))

<span id="r8"></span>
## NGINX Plus Release 8 (R8)
_19 January 2016_<br/>
_Based on NGINX Open Source 1.9.9_

NGINX Plus R8 is a feature release:

- [OAuth Technology Preview](https://www.nginx.com/blog/oauth-technology-preview/), which performs OAuth 2.0 processing for proxied applications

    **Note:** Before installing the `nginx-plus-http2` package, you must remove the `spdy` parameter on all `listen` directives in your configuration (replace it with the `http2` and `ssl` parameters to enable support for HTTP/2). NGINX Plus fails to start if any `listen` directives have the `spdy` parameter.

- Support for proxying [NTLM](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#ntlm) requests
- Enhancements to [TCP load balancing](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html) and proxying:

  - Client‑side [PROXY protocol](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_proxy_module.html#proxy_protocol) support
  - Ability to [set local IP address](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_proxy_module.html#proxy_bind) of origin for outgoing connections
  - New `backlog` parameter to [listen](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html#listen) directive to limit size of queue of pending connections
  - New [tcp_nodelay](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html#tcp_nodelay) directive to control use of OS `TCP_NODELAY` option
- More efficient distribution of connections across NGINX Plus worker processes (new `reuseport` parameter to the [listen](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#listen) directive)
- [Thread pools](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#thread_pool) for multithreaded reading and sending of files without blocking worker processes
- Live activity monitoring dashboard redesigned to use tabs
- Additional live activity monitoring metrics in the [Status](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html#compatibility) module (dataset version 6)

- New `-T` flag on `nginx` command to dump the configuration to standard output in a standardized format
- New [$upstream_connect_time](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#var_upstream_connect_time) variable to capture the connection time to upstream servers
- [sub_filter](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_sub_module.html#sub_filter) directive now supports variables in both the string being replaced and the replacement string; multiple `sub_filter` directives can appear at a configuration level
- In the `nginx-plus-extras` package:
  - New [Redis](http://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-redis) module for access to Redis databases through Lua
  - [Headers-More](http://github.com/openresty/headers-more-nginx-module) module updated to version 0.26
